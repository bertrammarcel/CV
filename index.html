          Especially by building up a UX Framework together with Daniel for the last 4 years. With a focus on the Design System as Product Owner and Product Manager.</p>

        <div class="nine columns subhead">
          As a team, we work uniquely well together. We are complementary counterparts. For each topic at least one of us is an expert and the other one is experienced.
          We are highly available and work with a lot of excitement. If one is down, the other is up.
        </div>
        </div>
        <p>In our last four years, we have learned that we can solve many different user experience issues
          better than anyone else through pairing. Our strengths and weaknesses complement each other ideally. We have learned a lot over the past few years. And have been able to build and evolve an
          enterprise-wide user experience culture for digital products from zero.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="six columns">
        <p><b>To explain this in a little bit more detail:</b> We closely work together as a team for 4 years and we
          drive User Experience mindset and working culture within digital product organizations at scale. Mostly
          for customer-facing websites and applications. Currently, we are establishing a UX Frameworks based on the three main pillars: 
          Firstly as Leads of the ”UX Design Operations Team” we take over
          the responsibility to enable the product organization to follow the corporate User Experience vision and
          strategy – through common design and working principles. As a team, we take ownership of the User
          Experience process and enablement to use the right tools and methods. Secondly, we establish a
          design culture by taking responsibility for different roles within the UX Community. Within guild meetings, 
          we share knowledge, success stories, and also empower collaboration.
          Furthermore, we use the format of an internal UX Academy to teach everyone in different UX-related topics, e.g. understanding 
          the basics of User Experience Design or special dicipline deep dives. And thirdly, we build up
          a scalable Design System to ensure an efficient and high qualitative code and design workflow. And create digital experiences we are proud of.</p>
