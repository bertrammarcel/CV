        <h2 style="margin-top:0;">Dear Mr. Young</h2>
        <div class="nine columns subhead">the application may be unconventional. But as a team, we also work uniquely well together. Therefore we
          use the unique opportunity to apply as a team for the vacant position Director of Design - Design System.</div>
        </div>
        <p>In our last four years we have learned that we can solve many different user experience issues
          better than anyone else through pairing. Our strengths and weaknesses complement each other ideally. At
          Porsche, we have learned a lot over the past few years. And have been able to build and evolve an
          enterprise wide user experience culture for digital products from zero. Now we want to do this for a
          company that is on a higher digital maturity.</p>

        <p>Even though our current working scope at Porsche is already highly focused on assuring the best possible
          User Experience – operating as Director(s) of Design – Design Systems at Zalando would give us the
          room to think even bigger and achieve possible strategic improvements for a much bigger scope.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="six columns">
        <p><b>To explain this a little bit more detailed:</b> We closely work together as a team for 4 years at Porsche and we
          drive User Experience mindset and working culture within our digital product organization at scale. Mostly
          for customer facing websites and applications. Currently we are working on a UX Framework for Porsche
          which is based on three main pillars: firstly as a Leads of the ”UX Design Operations Team” we take over
          the responsibility to enable the product organization to follow the Porsche User Experience vision and
          strategy – through common design and working principles. As a team, we take ownership of the User
          Experience process and enablement to use the right tools and methods. Secondly, we established a
          design culture at Porsche by taking responsibility of the worldwide UX Community with more than a 100
          designers. Within guild meetings we share knowledge, success stories and also empower collaboration.
          Furthermore we introduced the UX academy, where teams are educated in different UX related topics, e.g.
          articulating design decisions or the usage of a holistic Porsche customer journey. And thirdly, we build up
          a scalable Porsche Design System to ensure high qualitative code and design within our digital products
          that we are proud of: <a href="https://designsystem.porsche.com">Porsche Design System</a></p>

        <p>Personally, we gathered a lot of experience over the last years and we would also see ourselves as capable
          of taking the responsibility for this position. If you want to get more insights about our work, we
          recommend our Medium articles or Daniels podcast interview at Sports Maniac. Our curiosity for a new
          chapter in our life and the passion for the topic gives us again – the courage – to apply as a team.</p>
