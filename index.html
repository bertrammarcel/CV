        <p>I am now working for over 12 years at an automotive manufacturer, where I studied Business Administration and Engineering as a combined on-the-job training. 
          I am passionate about empowering the organization with modern UX tools and how to use them effectively. As a member of the Marketing team, I am committed to elevating both the visual appearance as well as the user experience on a corporate level and driving the design strategy of the brand forward.

        <p>As a self-employed freelancer since 2008, I already became enthusiastic about web development and design very early. 
          Nowadays I am experienced in different areas of UX Design and Web Development - either using it myself or guide experts through my deep expertise. 
          Especially by building up the corporate UX strategy and organizations within different companies with Daniel for the last years.</p>

          I started my professional career at Borussia Dortmund in the successful years 2011-2014 in the online sector. 
          There I was mainly responsible for the most important platforms BVB.de and Shop.BVB.de</p>
        <p>After an emotionally influential time, my journey went to Stuttgart, where I have been working for six years at an automotive manufacturer.

        <div class="nine columns subhead">
          As a team, we work uniquely well together. We are complementary counterparts. For each topic at least one of us is an expert and the other one is experienced.
          We are highly available and work with a lot of excitement. If one is down, the other is up.
        </div>
        </div>
        <p>In our last four years, we have learned that we can solve many different user experience issues
          better than anyone else through pairing. Our strengths and weaknesses complement each other ideally. We have learned a lot over the past few years. And have been able to build and evolve an
          enterprise-wide user experience culture for digital products from zero.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="six columns">
        <p><b>To explain this in a little bit more detail:</b> We closely work together as a team for 7 years and we
          drive User Experience mindset and working culture within digital product organizations at scale. Mostly
          for customer-facing websites and applications. Currently, we are establishing a UX Frameworks based on the three main pillars: 
          Firstly as Leads of the ”UX Design Operations Team” we take over
          the responsibility to enable the product organization to follow the corporate User Experience vision and
          strategy – through common design and working principles. As a team, we take ownership of the User
          Experience process and enablement to use the right tools and methods. Secondly, we establish a
          design culture by taking responsibility for different roles within the UX Community. Within guild meetings, 
          we share knowledge, success stories, and also empower collaboration.
          Furthermore, we use the format of an internal UX Academy to teach everyone in different UX-related topics, e.g. understanding 
          the basics of User Experience Design or special dicipline deep dives. And thirdly, we build up
          a scalable Design System to ensure an efficient and high qualitative code and design workflow. And create digital experiences we are proud of.</p>

        Great Product Design relies heavily on user feedback. With the <b>Usability Testing Marketplace</b> we created a concept to both easily test products and increase the oranizational understanding. Our book will introduce the idea and give a concrete guideline on how to conduct it on your own. The book will be released in mid of 2021.
